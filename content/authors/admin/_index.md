I am an [incoming] Assistant Professor at the University of Florida, where I direct the Social Science Collaboratory: a space to focus on advancing collaborative research methods in social sciences.\
\
Much of my work focuses on affective science, big team science, and AI. For example, I have leveraged collaborative methods to examine the extent to which the conscious experience of emotion is built off sensorimotor feedback from the peripheral nervous system (e.g., changes in heart rate and muscle tension). I’ve found support for such ideas through (a) a [meta-analysis](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fbul0000194) of nearly 50 years of scientific progress, (b) an [adversarial collaboration](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01458-9) involving researchers from 19 countries, and (c) six [theory falsification attempts](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fpspa0000316) run across 29 countries.\
\
More recently, I founded the [Emotion Physiology and Experience Collaboration](https://epic-collab.github.io/), which seeks to understand how advancements in machine learning might be used to monitor, understand, and change humans’ emotions – for good and bad. Through this work, I have also written about the benefits and challenges of big team science, offering leadership, support, and critical reflection to a variety of these initiatives -- e.g., the [Psychological Science Accelerator](https://psysciacc.org/), [Global Gratitude Project](https://www.templeton.org/grant/uncovering-the-cognitive-and-cultural-foundations-of-gratitude), and the [Virtual Experience Research Accelerator](https://sreal.ucf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/vera_summary.pdf).
