Nicholas Coles is a Research Scientist at Stanford University and the Director of the Psychological Science Accelerator. He conducts research in affective science, cross-cultural psychology, and meta-science.

In affective science, Nicholas seeks to understand the social, cognitive, and physiological processes that underlie emotion. Much of his research in this domain has focused on the facial feedback hypothesis, the idea that sensorimotor feedback from facial expression movements can impact emotional processes (e.g., that smiling can make people feel happy).\
\
In meta-science, Nicholas seeks to build research infrastructure that allows researchers to obtain generalizable knowledge about psychological phenomena. He serves as the Director of the Psychological Science Accelerator: a globally distributed consortium of researchers who pool intellectual and material resources to accelerate the accumulation of generalizable knowledge in psychology. Nicholas is particularly interested in coordinating collaborations that allow researchers not only to test the generalizability of conclusions across different cultures, but also across different methods, measures, and statistical models.
